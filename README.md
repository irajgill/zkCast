## Overview
zkCast is a zero-knowledge (ZK) voting system implementation in Circom. This project provides a simple, privacy-preserving voting protocol using ZK proofs, specifically focusing on anonymous vote selection. The included Circom code demonstrates how a user's vote can be committed without revealing their choice, yet still allows verification that the vote is valid and belongs to a specific candidate index.

## Quick-start
1. Prerequisites
-- Rust ≥1.70 (for the Circom compiler)

-- Node.js ≥18

-- circom (Rust version)

-- snarkjs (installed globally)
